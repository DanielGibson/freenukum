This is a git mirror of the (old, abandoned) FreeNukum bazaar repo at https://launchpad.net/freenukum/trunk - apparently in a broken state, maybe don't use the last commits.. 

*However*, note that the original author picked up the project up again,
see https://gitlab.com/silwol/freenukum
So if you're interested in the project, that's the place to look for current development.
